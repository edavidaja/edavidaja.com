A take on the Jungle Bird featuring some DC ingredients.

![recipe ingredients](/img/swamp-bird.jpg)

[Cotton and Reed PX Dark Rum](https://www.cottonandreed.com/rums), 2 oz  
[Capitoline Tiber](https://www.capitolinevermouth.com/bottlings), 3/4 oz  
pineapple gomme syrup, 3/4 oz  
lime juice, 1/2 oz  

shake over ice, strain, and serve.

## notes

- Tiber has a particularly assertive bittnerness, and seems less sweet than Campari, which makes for a good pairing with the sweetness and mouthfeel of the pineapple gomme.
- The pineapple gomme is made with the Cocktail Codex recipe.
