## tl;dr

- I implemented a [todo backend in R](https://github.com/edavidaja/todo-backend-plumber) with [plumber](https://rplumber.io).
- Use Rocker with PPAs for fast container builds. Dirk Eddelbuettel [demonstrates how at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIjWirNma-8).

## todo backend

[Todo-Backend](http://todobackend.com/) is "a shared example to showcase backend tech stacks", inspired by the front-end [todomvc](http://todomvc.com/).  
It's a good way to get a sense for how you might implement similar functionality in other languages.
I'd read some other posts on [setting up plumber apis](https://medium.com/tmobile-tech/r-can-api-c184951a24a3?) so I decided to give it a shot.

### the tests

Creating a todo backend requires [passing sixteen tests](http://todobackend.com/specs/index.html?https://todo-backend-plumber.herokuapp.com/), which confirm that your API is implemented according to the specification.

### the stack

I made my choices about hosting and database providers based on where I would be able to run the API without paying for it. I tried Google Cloud Run, which can host containers that automatically scale to 0 if your API is not receiving any requests, but mysterious failures led me to use Heroku instead.[^deployment-issues]

I also decided to use a relational database to store the data to get some more practice with DBI.
As far as I can tell, leaving even the smallest Google Cloud SQL instance running indefinitely would have cost a few dollars a month, so instead I went with a free [elephantsql](https://www.elephantsql.com/) instance.

## CORS

The tests require your API to support [cross-origin resource sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).
the plumber docs illustrate how to do this for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, but additional headers have to be set in order for the API to respond correctly to `OPTIONS` requests, [as demonstrated here.](https://github.com/rstudio/plumber/issues/66#issuecomment-418660334)

## connecting to the database

Following the [12-factor best practice](https://12factor.net/config), the database connection information is stored in an `.Renviron` file.[^no-dotenv-ppa]
I went through several rounds of testing where I would try the database functions interactively, they would work as expected, and then once I built and deployed the container the database connection would fail.
A solution to this problem is to [use a pool.](https://github.com/rstudio/pool)

In the file that starts the container I initialize the connection:

```r
con <-
  dbPool(
    drv      = RPostgres::Postgres(),
    dbname   = Sys.getenv("DB_NAME"),
    host     = Sys.getenv("DB_HOST"),
    port     = 5432,
    user     = Sys.getenv("DB_NAME"),
    password = Sys.getenv("DB_PASS"),
    maxSize  = 5 # connection limit for elephantsql instance class
  )
```
And then in the functions that query the database, I pass this connection object along:

```r
get_todos <- function(con) {
  dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM todos")
}
```

Some functions emit warnings if a "statement" rather than a "query" (which would return data) is sent; to suppress that warning, you can explicitly check out and then return a connection from the pool:

```r
delete_todos <- function(con) {
  pool <- poolCheckout(con)
  rs <- dbSendQuery(pool, "DELETE FROM todos")
  dbClearResult(rs)
  poolReturn(pool)
}
```
The pool also handles what might otherwise be annoying details to manage. For example, I set a maximum connections limit that matches the number of connections allowed by the size of my database connection instance.

## know your default arguments

For the first several tests, no "order" item is provided, but later tests supply and modify the order, title, and completion status. 
It took me a few tries to arrive at a working specification of default arguments.[^on-syntax]

First, the functions that query the database:

```r
create_todo <- function(con, req, title, order = NULL, completed = FALSE) {

  todo_order <- order %||% NA_integer_
  ...
}

update_todo <- function(con, id, title = NULL, order = NULL, completed = NULL) {
  c(old_title, old_completed, old_order) %<-%
  dbGetQuery(
    con,
    'SELECT title, completed, "order" FROM todos WHERE id = $1',
    params = list(id)
  )
  ...
}

```

Setting `order`, `title`, and `completed` to `NULL` indicate that they _can_ be supplied as default arguments, but don't have to be present, as shown in `update_todo()`.
Then, within the function body you can test for whether the argument was supplied, as in `create_todo()`. 

By default, Plumber APIs will [parse the body](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/routing-and-input.html#request-body) of a `POST` request.
The tests are sent to the API as JSON, so you can supply the keys of the object as arguments to the function.
Again, since `order` and `completed` are only set in some of the tests, the default should be set to `NULL`:

```r
#' @get /
#' @post /
#' @delete /
function(req, res, title, order = NULL, completed) {
  method <- req$REQUEST_METHOD

  if (method == "POST") {
    out <- create_todo(con, req, title, order)
    res$status <- 201
    return(out)
  }
  ...
}

#' @get /<id:int>
#' @patch /<id:int>
#' @delete /<id:int>
function(req, res, id, title = NULL, order = NULL, completed = NULL) {
  method <- req$REQUEST_METHOD

  if (method == "PATCH") {
    return(update_todo(con, id, title, order, completed))
  }
  ...
}

```

Because the database functions are set up to check for null arguments, supplying `order` as an argument when the functions are _called_ at the endpoint ensures that the right thing will happen.

## fast docker builds

### first attempt: {renv}

Are you using [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)? It makes versioning your dependencies delightfully easy; check it out.
However, using it with docker can be pretty slow.

Building a [container](https://github.com/edavidaja/todo-backend-plumber/blob/3f8620e3df777feda742ea73c4d1b4b921db53d4/Dockerfile) by running `renv::restore()` took about 16 minutes.[^sysreqs]

{{< figure src="img/docker-build-renv-start.png" alt="start of docker build with renv">}} 

{{< figure src="img/docker-build-renv.png" alt="16 minutes later">}} 

There is an article on the renv website about how to [speed up package builds when using docker](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/docker.html), but figuring out how to make use of the renv cache will have to be another blog post.

### docker with PPAs

PPAs are "personal package archives".
In this case, the relevant personal archives are supplied by Dirk Eddelbuettel and Michael Rutter, and they contain R packages that can be installed as binaries rather than being compiled from source.
To use them, I switched to the `rocker/r-ubuntu` [image](https://github.com/edavidaja/todo-backend-plumber/blob/master/Dockerfile) and installed the relevant packages via `apt-get`.

{{< figure src="img/docker-build-ppa-start.png" alt="start of docker build with ppa">}} 

{{< figure src="img/docker-build-ppa.png" alt="2.5 minutes later">}}

The build time drops to about 2.5 minutes.
If you're paying for build minutes or worried about build timeouts, give `rocker/r-ubuntu` a look.

### renv + PPAs

Make sure to add the `.Rprofile` generated by renv to your `.dockerignore` file; otherwise renv will install itself when your R process starts, and your script will be unable to find your packages.

## reasonable next steps

### better error handling

Plumber is pretty graceful about generating `500` errors if there are bugs in your endpoint code, but more thoughtful error handling is never a bad thing.

### make it a package

There's an example [plumber api package](https://github.com/sol-eng/plumbpkg) on the RStudio Solutions Engineering Github page, which illustrates how to deploy API code as a package.

[^deployment-issues]: All of the tests pass when the api is served via [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) or when the container is deployed to Heroku, but when deployed to Google Cloud Run, some earlier tests pass but others fail with CORS issues. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
[^no-dotenv-ppa]: Initially I tried used Gabor Csardi's [`{dotenv}`](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/dotenv), but it was not in the PPA.
[^on-syntax]: `%||%`, the "coalescing null," is borrowed from rlang. I consulted a [nodejs example](https://github.com/vladaspasic/todo-backend-micro/blob/master/routes.js) that filled me with destructuring assignment envy, and since {RPostgres} comes with {zeallot} I decided to take advantage.
[^sysreqs]: I imagine there is a way to automate the installation of system requirements instead of doing [this](https://github.com/edavidaja/todo-backend-plumber/blob/3f8620e3df777feda742ea73c4d1b4b921db53d4/Dockerfile#L4), but I'm not sure what it is.
