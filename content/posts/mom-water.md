Have you ever wanted to know what marketing tastes like?  Grab a box of Mom Water for your next party. Your guests will love the eye-catching pastels and the delightful schtick of flavors named for women of a certain age:

- Sandy, or Coconut Melon, which finishes like a a melted coconut icee
- Julie, or Passionfruit, devoid of passion or fruit
- Karen, or Lemon Blueberry, the wedge in that glass of water you meant to get back to

Each flavor has its own way of announcing, "the party was yesterday."
